Legal Vue is a bespoke cross-platform legal practice management software application. It allows a law firm to easily manage a shared database of clients, cases, and matters through an intuitive and fast user-interface. The software gives firms complete freedom and peace-of-mind for how to control their own data in a secure format, without the need for complicated IT configurations or subscription services.  

Eshin to add images here....

To build the application, our team used the latest in web and database technologies while working closely with our clients to ensure the app looked, felt, and operated in a way that suited their needs. 

At Synapse Insights we take our customers' needs seriously. We strive to work with you as closely as possible to deliver a product that is exactly to your specification.

<span style="font-size: .75em; font-style:italic;">Legal Vue is bespoke application and is therefore not available for public use or purchase.</span>
