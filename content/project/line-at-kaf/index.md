Line@KAF is a real-time customer queue-tracking mobile and web application. It was designed to provide real-time information about the length of the queue at King Arthur Flower, a popular cafe at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/). The app enables customers to browse the menu and prices, see data on popular times by hour, and submit their requests and feedback to the developers and KAF staff.

To make the app possible, our team used a combination of tools including computer vision algorithms, neural network models, and cloud computing services.
